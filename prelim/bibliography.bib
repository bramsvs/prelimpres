Previous studies assume that the fault has been detected and isolated and then design a fault-tolerant controller. The present paper proposes a complete active fault-tolerant control system which copes with not only fault detection and isolation but also fault-tolerant control. A novel and efﬁcient fault detection and isolation approach is proposed for the total rotor failure case. An incremental nonlinear dynamic inversion approach is introduced to design the fault-tolerant controller for the quadrotor in the presence of the fault. The complete active fault-tolerant control system enables the quadrotor to achieve any position even after the complete loss of one rotor.},

Physical damage to a propeller causes additional vibration in the system during operation, and early detection of such faults may prevent further damage and potentially later catastrophic failure. In the proposed method, only a built-in accelerometer (as typically used by a multicopters ﬂight computer) is used to provide vibration data of the vehicle, and no additional sensors are required. We exploit the fact that the motors rotate at different speeds during different phases of maneuvers, allowing a spectral analysis of measured vibrations to isolate a damaged motor. This method is shown to be effective at identifying multiple damaged propellers as well, and experimental results are presented to validate the concept.},

We extend the existing work on polynomial trajectory generation by presenting a method of jointly optimizing polynomial path segments in an unconstrained quadratic program that is numerically stable for highorder polynomials and large numbers of segments, and is easily formulated for efﬁcient sparse computation. We also present a technique for automatically selecting the amount of time allocated to each segment, and hence the quadrotor speeds along the path, as a function of a single parameter determining aggressiveness, subject to actuator constraints. The use of polynomial trajectories, coupled with the differentially ﬂat representation of the quadrotor, eliminates the need for computationally intensive sampling and simulation in the high dimensional state space of the vehicle during motion planning. Our approach generates high-quality trajectories much faster than purely sampling-based optimal kinodynamic planning methods, but sacriﬁces the guarantee of asymptotic convergence to the global optimum that those methods provide. We demonstrate the performance of our algorithm by efﬁciently generating trajectories through challenging indoor spaces and successfully traversing them at speeds up to 8 m/s. A demonstration of our algorithm and ﬂight performance is available at: http://groups.csail.mit.edu/rrg/quad\_polynomial\_ trajectory\_planning.},

  abstract = {The bang-bang type optimal control problems arising from time-optimal or fuel-optimal trajectory planning in aerospace engineering are computationally intractable. This paper suggests a hybrid computational framework that utilizes differential flatness and mapped Chebyshev pseudospectral method to generate a related but smooth trajectory, from which the original non-smooth solutions are achieved continuously by the analytic homotopic algorithm. The flatness allows for transcribing the original problem into an integration-free flat outputs optimization problem with reduced number of decision variables. Chebyshev pseudospectral method is applied to parameterizing the flat outputs, and the numerical accuracy for the derivatives of flat outputs at collocation nodes, which are readily computed using differentiation matrices, is greatly enhanced by conformal map and barycentric rational interpolation techniques. Based on the obtained smooth trajectory, the analytic homotopic approach constructs an auxiliary optimal control problem whose costates are simply zero, avoiding the estimation of initial costates. The hybrid framework successfully addresses the difficulties of pseudospectral method and homotopic approach when they are applied separately. Numerical simulations of time-optimal trajectory planning for spacecraft relative motion and attitude maneuver are presented, validating the performance of the hybrid computational framework.

The key quality of the algorithm lies in the use of the barycentric interpolation formula when solving the least squares problem with various grid resolutions. High-accuracy of the proposed estimation method is contributed to this interpolation formula that is found to be numerically stable and computationally effective.

  abstract = {The attitude optimal control problem (OCP) of a two-rigid-body spacecraft with two rigid bodies coupled by a ball-in-socket joint is considered. Based on conservation of angular momentum of the system without the external torque, a dynamic equation of three-dimensional attitude motion of the system is formulated. The attitude motion planning problem of the coupled-rigid-body spacecraft can be converted to a discrete nonlinear programming (NLP) problem using the Chebyshev-Gauss pseudospectral method (CGPM). Solutions of the NLP problem can be obtained using the sequential quadratic programming (SQP) algorithm. Since the collocation points of the CGPM are Chebyshev-Gauss (CG) points, the integration of cost function can be approximated by the Clenshaw-Curtis quadrature, and the corresponding quadrature weights can be calculated eﬃciently using the fast Fourier transform (FFT). To improve computational eﬃciency and numerical stability, the barycentric Lagrange interpolation is presented to substitute for the classic Lagrange interpolation in the approximation of state and control variables. Furthermore, numerical ﬂoat errors of the state diﬀerential matrix and barycentric weights can be alleviated using trigonometric identity especially when the number of CG points is large. A simple yet eﬃcient method is used to avoid sensitivity to the initial values for the SQP algorithm using a layered optimization strategy from a feasible solution to an optimal solution. Eﬀectiveness of the proposed algorithm is perfect for attitude motion planning of a two-rigid-body spacecraft coupled by a ball-in-socket joint through numerical simulation.},

This paper contributes to fault-tolerant ﬂight of multirotor helicopter with the following four points. First, given the conﬁguration of the multirotor vehicle, this paper shows how to calculate the maximum torques that can be produced on each vehicle axis. Second, a method to investigate the static controllability of the vehicle in any arbitrary fault conﬁguration is described. Third, a control allocator for multirotor systems is developed with performance going beyond performance obtained with classical methods, such as the pseudo-inverse method. The proposed control allocator is indeed capable of exploiting the whole attainable control set. Fourth, this control allocator is fault-tolerant, as it can efﬁciently cope with the loss of one or more actuators.},

  abstract = {Micro Aerial Vehicles (MAVs) are limited in their operation outdoors near obstacles by their ability to withstand wind gusts. Currently widespread position control methods such as Proportional Integral Derivative control do not perform well under the influence of gusts. Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI) is a sensor-based control technique that can control nonlinear systems subject to disturbances. It was developed for the attitude control of manned aircraft or MAVs. In this paper we generalize this method to the outer loop control of MAVs under severe gust loads. Significant improvements over a traditional Proportional Integral Derivative (PID) controller are demonstrated in an experiment where the quadrotor flies in and out of a windtunnel exhaust at 10 m/s. The control method does not rely on frequent position updates, as is demonstrated in an outside experiment using a standard GPS module. Finally, we investigate the effect of using a linearization to calculate thrust vector increments, compared to a nonlinear calculation. The method requires little modeling and is computationally efficient.},

Observation of the network weights shows which basis functions dominate, thereby revealing information about the physical system. During this analysis step, only the dominant functions are retained to reduce error variance. In a further refinement step, several sigmoid functions are added to the network to generate a smooth stepwise approximation to the part of the mapping unexplained by the dominant basis functions. By implementing the network, it is possible to generate a structural model for a 3 kW induction motor. The network exhibits a 100\% success rate in the detection of 1.8 A armature current variations},

We first verify that the local solution to such problems is very much like that of the linear-quadratic approximation, possessing a local C2 value function and with optimal trajectories that are the image of trajectories on stable manifold of the Hamiltonian vector field. Then we proceed to study the nonlocal structure. This is accomplished by converting the infinite horizon problem into a finite horizon problem using the local C2 value function as a terminal cost. Optimal trajectories of this finite horizon problem (and hence the infinite horizon problem) are shown to always exist and to be somewhat regular. Moreover, the optimal trajectories are always the image of Hamiltonian trajectories on the global stable manifold. This gives a result on the structure of the Hamiltonian global stable manifold. These ideas are illustrated using the familiar inverted pendulum on a cart example},

  abstract = {This chapter considers sliding modes applied to the problem of observer design. The historical development is outlined leading to the description of a specific class of sliding mode observer which will be used throughout the book. It will be shown how the unique properties associated with the so-called equivalent injection signal necessary to maintain sliding can be exploited to reconstruct actuator and sensor faults modelled as additive perturbations to the inputs and the outputs of the plant. Design methodologies based on Linear Matrix Inequalities (LMIs) are presented. These approaches exploit all the available degrees of freedom associated with the choice of the observer gains. The chapter describes sliding mode observers which can reconstruct faults and yet be robust to disturbances/uncertainties which may corrupt the quality of the reconstructions resulting from mismatches between the model about which the observer is designed and the real system. Initially, the design method is formulated for the case of actuator faults. A comparison is also made between the sliding mode observer schemes developed in the chapter and more traditional linear unknown input observers which are prevalent in the literature.},

In sliding mode schemes, a switching function typically dictates which structure of control law is to be used at a particular time instant, depending on the position of the state from the sliding surface .},

Achieving performance close to the nominal and maintaining overall closed-loop stability in the face of actuator faults/failures and in the presence of aerodynamic disturbances (i.e. wind gusts) and sensor noise is the main objective. An LMI based procedure is described to synthesise the controller parameters, and a rigorous closed-loop stability analysis is carried out in the presence of unmatched uncertainty for a suitable set of actuator faults/failures . The FTC scheme is compared in simulation with the one from Chap. 3 by considering the same manoeuvre on the RECOVER benchmark model in the presence of wind gusts and sensor noise.},

  abstract = {ABSTRACT: This study is concerned with the bumpless transfer problem for switched systems with partial actuator failures, in order to obtain smooth system performance output transition. Taking into account that the system requires a controller switching from current sub-controller to a fault-tolerant sub-controller after actuator fault. And bumpless transfer for control input cannot be traditionally designed when the actuator fault occurs, while performance smoothing can be considered and it is actually the ultimate goal of bumpless transfer. Specifically, the actuator fault model is firstly established and partial actuator fault is considered. Then, the system performance output signal is deemed as the main design variable of bumpless transfer, and closed-loop control systems both previous and after controller switching are constructed. Moreover, by using model matching thought and the adaptive sliding mode control technique, a bumpless transfer compensator design strategy is given to drive the performance output variable (after controller switching) to track the one of reference model. At last, simulation results of numeric and application examples demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed bumpless transfer strategy. © 2015 Taylor \& Francis.},

  abstract = {This paper addresses the problem of Faut Detection and Diagnosis (FDD) of a quadrotor helicopter system in the presence of actuator faults. To this end a Two-Stage Kalman Filter (TSKF) is used to simultaneously estimate and isolate possible faults in each actuator. The faults are modelled as losses in control effectiveness of rotors. Three fault scenarios are investigated: loss of control effectiveness in one single actuator, simultaneous loss of control effectiveness in all motors, and loss of control effectiveness in three motors with different magnitudes. The developed FDD algorithm is evaluated through experimental application to an unmanned quadrotor helicopter testbed available at the Department of Mechanical and Industrial Engineering of Concordia University, called Qball-X4. The obtained results show the effectiveness of the proposed FDD method.},

The IMM algorithm computes (online) the posterior probability of each failure model, that can be interpreted as a failure indicator. The fault tolerant control approach presented is based on a multiple model control law, where an optimal controller is designed for each actuator failure model, and the control action is a combination of the individual outputs of each controller weighted by the posterior probability associated with that model. The new FDI-FTC approach was tested on a linear simulation of Bell Helicopter's Eagle-Eye unmanned air vehicle. All single sensor and actuator failures were detected and properly identified, as well as some simultaneous failures.},

First, the dynamic model of a QUAV taking into account actuator faults and external disturbances is constructed. Then, treating the actuator faults and external disturbances as augmented system states, an adaptive augmented state Kalman filter (AASKF), is developed without the need of make the assumption that the exact stochastic information of actuator faults and external disturbances are available. Next, in order to reduce the computational load of AASKF, an adaptive three-stage Kalman filter (AThSKF) is proposed by decoupling the AASKF into three subfilters. The AThSKF-based FDD scheme can not only detect and isolate actuator faults but also estimate the magnitudes even if the QUAV suffers from the external disturbances. Finally, the performance of the FDD scheme is evaluated under different fault scenarios, and simulation results demonstrate the effectiveness of the proposed method.},

Then, based on active disturbance rejection control (ADRC), the fault tolerant controller is proposed to recover faulty system and reject perturbations. The developed controller takes wind gusts, actuator faults and measurement noises as total perturbations which are estimated by improved extended state observer (ESO) and compensated by nonlinear feedback control law. So, the developed robust fault tolerant controller can successfully accomplish the tracking of the desired output values. Finally, some simulation studies are given to illustrate the effectiveness of fault recovery of the proposed scheme and also its ability to attenuate external disturbances that are introduced from environmental causes such as wind gusts and measurement noises.},

The control law does require feedback of effector positions to accommodate actuator dynamics. Both accelerometer and rate gyro failure detection and isolation (FDI) systems are implemented, allowing up to three independent failures for each FDI system as long as they are in different axes. Nonlinear simulation results show that the FDI systems improve the robustness to accelerometer/rate gyro uncertainties. An advanced tailless aircraft model is used to demonstrate the concepts.

  abstract = {We present a novel, deeply embedded robotics middleware and programming environment. It uses a multithreaded, publish-subscribe design pattern and provides a Unix-like software interface for micro controller applications. We improve over the state of the art in deeply embedded open source systems by providing a modular and standards-oriented platform. Our system architecture is centered around a publish-subscribe object request broker on top of a POSIX application programming interface. This allows to reuse common Unix knowledge and experience, including a bash-like shell. We demonstrate with a vertical takeoff and landing (VTOL) use case that the system modularity is well suited for novel and experimental vehicle platforms. We also show how the system architecture allows a direct interface to ROS and to run individual processes either as native ROS nodes on Linux or nodes on the micro controller, maximizing interoperability. Our microcontroller-based execution environment has substantially lower latency and better hardware connectivity than a typical Robotics Linux system and is therefore well suited for fast, high rate control tasks.},

  abstract = {A systematic fault tolerant control (FTC) scheme based on fault estimation for a quadrotor actuator, which integrates normal control, active and passive FTC and fault parking is proposed in this paper. Firstly, an adaptive Thau observer (ATO) is presented to estimate the quadrotor rotor fault magnitudes, and then faults with different magnitudes and time-varying natures are rated into corresponding fault severity levels based on the pre-deﬁned fault-tolerant boundaries. Secondly, a systematic FTC strategy which can coordinate various FTC methods is designed to compensate for failures depending on the fault types and severity levels. Unlike former stand-alone passive FTC or active FTC, our proposed FTC scheme can compensate for faults in a way of condition-based maintenance (CBM), and especially consider the fatal failures that traditional FTC techniques cannot accommodate to avoid the crashing of UAVs. Finally, various simulations are carried out to show the performance and effectiveness of the proposed method.},

  abstract = {This paper proposes an Incremental Sliding Mode Control driven by Sliding Mode Disturbance Observers (INDI-SMC/SMDO), with application to a quadrotor fault tolerant control problem. By designing the SMC/SMDO based on the control structure of the sensor-based Incremental Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (INDI), instead of the model-based Nonlinear Dynamic Inversion (NDI) in the literature, the model dependency of the controller and the uncertainties in the closed-loop system are simultaneously reduced. This allows INDI-SMC/SMDO to passively resist a wider variety of faults and external disturbances using continuous control inputs with lower control and observer gains. When applied to a quadrotor, both numerical simulations and real-world ﬂight tests demonstrate that INDI based SMC/SMDO has better performance and robustness over NDI based SMC/SMDO, in the presence of model uncertainties, wind disturbances, and sudden actuator faults. Moreover, the implementation process is simpliﬁed because of the reduced model dependency and smaller uncertainty variations of INDI-SMC/SMDO. Therefore, the proposed control method can be easily implemented to improve the performance and survivability of quadrotors in real life.},

The fault diagnosis architecture consists of a nonlinear fault detection estimator and a bank of nonlinear adaptive fault isolation estimators designed based on the functional structures of the faults under consideration. Adaptive thresholds for fault detection and isolation are systematically designed to enhance the robustness and fault sensitivity of the diagnostic algorithm. After fault isolation, the fault parameter estimate generated by the matched isolation estimator is used for accommodating the fault effect. Using an indoor quadrotor test environment, real-time experimental results are shown to illustrate the effectiveness of the algorithms.},

The proposed fault-tolerant control scheme combines a bank of observers for diagnosis with the concept of the virtual actuator for control reconfiguration. Therefore, an evaluation method for fault detection and isolation is presented, which guarantees that the diagnosis result is always adequate for control reconfiguration. The experiments with a hovering multirotor UAV subject to a rotor failure validate the applicability of the proposed FTC scheme under real-time constraints and in the presence of natural uncertainties, measurement noise and process disturbances.},

FTA methods comprise of a wide variety of modelling and analysis techniques, supported by a wide range of software tools. This paper surveys over 150 papers on fault tree analysis, providing an in-depth overview of the state-of-the-art in FTA.

For these models, we review both qualitative analysis methods, like cut sets and common cause failures, and quantitative techniques, including a wide variety of stochastic methods to compute failure probabilities. Numerous examples illustrate the various approaches, and tables present a quick overview of results.},
